# WWWBoard-Lite
A fun example of how something written in very old and crufty 1990's Perl style can be much better and simpler with Mojolicious.

The idea is to make a single-file, fully functional version using Mojolicious::Lite and modern Perl best-practices (to the best of my abilities, anyway).

Currently just a WIP - it looks like the old WWWBoard, but doesn't yet accept posts, validate the forms, do any authorization/authentication, etc.
